(E.g., &quot;60% liklihood of being undoctored.&quot;) This is probably already true about photos, although the expense of making a perfect fake is still pretty high, in terms of expertise.<p>I&#x27;d argue the &quot;natural state&quot; is one where word-of-mouth and first-hand accounts are the most authoritative evidence we can have (other than physical evidence like DNA left behind). And even physical evidence left behind can&#x27;t tell us what the person did while there or how an event transpired.<p>2. Tracking communications. In the digital age, we&#x27;ve some people have come to assume that all digital text is untrackable and anonymous. Your &quot;11001110&quot; is the same as mine. Historically, it was pretty difficult to transcribe information without leaving traces of the origin of that info. These zero-width characters plus all the other text fingerprinting methods, and ubiquitous tracking in communication logs make it nearly impossible, again, to communicate with others without leaving a trail. And then there&#x27;s the writing style analysis which makes it tough to write anything without leaving telltale fingerprints.<p>So, I&#x27;m proposing that we are returning to the &quot;natural state&quot; of things. Probably overstating things a bit, but still an interesting thought to consider.","time":1522859568,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Someone1234","id":16756388,"kids":[16756785],"parent":16755800,"text":"Why would a website flow through a user&#x27;s clipboard?","time":1522859844,"type":"comment"},{"by":"drabie","id":16756440,"score":1,"time":1522860121,"title":"Tovala (Smart Oven YC W16) Looking for First PM in Chicago","type":"job","url":"http://www.tovala.com/careers"},{"by":"boramalper","id":16756456,"kids":[16756656],"parent":16754987,"text":"The project is clearly motivated by <i>Be careful what you copy: Invisibly inserting usernames into text</i>[0] (posted 12 hours ago on HN), and many people here might think zero-width characters (or rather, any esoteric Unicode characters) are the only (or the prominent) way to watermark texts, which is wrong. The whole topic -<i>watermarking</i>- is worth at the very least a lengthy blog post, and maybe even several articles, so keep in mind that this comment is just a very brief introduction to different methods (of watermarking)[x]:<p>(from trivial to more complex ones)<p>----<p>1. Using Invisible Characters<p>The linked[0] article basically talks about a very basic version of it, which should be enough to get the idea. Of course, more sophisticated techniques will use more than just two characters, and will take the <i>position</i> of each invisible character into consideration while encoding &amp; decoding watermarks, ensure it&#x27;s uniformly distributed throughout the paragraphs etc.<p>Can be defeated by simply removing invisible characters.<p>----<p>2. Using Unicode Characters That Look Alike<p>The same working mechanism as <i>IDN homograph attack</i>[1].<p>Can be defeated by simply removing &quot;out-of-place&quot; letters&#x2F;characters, after determining the language of a given text&#x2F;paragraph&#x2F;sentence etc.<p>----<p>3. Using Unicode Equivalence<p>&gt; Code point sequences that are defined as canonically equivalent are assumed to have the same appearance and meaning when printed or displayed. For example, the code point U+006E (the Latin lowercase &quot;n&quot;) followed by U+0303 (the combining tilde &quot;◌̃&quot;) is defined by Unicode to be canonically equivalent to the single code point U+00F1 (the lowercase letter &quot;ñ&quot; of the Spanish alphabet).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unicode_equivalence\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unicode_equivalence</a><p>Can be defeated by simply normalising the text, and line endings!<p>----<p>(Now it&#x27;s getting harder!)<p>4. Changing the Layout of Documents<p>You can change (the rendering of):<p><pre><code>  (a) the margins\n  (b) the ligatures\n  (c) the space between\n    (i)  specific characters [kerning]\n    (ii) consequent words&#x2F;lines&#x2F;paragraphs\n</code></pre>\nto embed fingerprints. This is especially dangerous as documents are often leaked by taking screenshots or photocopies, which is secure against Unicode attacks, but not of these.<p>Can be defeated by copying the plaintext, and pasting it to a text editor, and applying steps 1, 2, 3.<p>Also, bear in mind that if you can still -unintentionally- leak information:<p>(a) when you use a document editor (LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word) as the layout engines might act differently depending on your software version, platform, file format etc.<p>(b) paper size (A4, US Letter, ...)<p>----<p>5. Substituting with Synonyms<p>If characters can be replaced by their equivalents, why not replace words or sentences even? Words can be substituted by their synonyms based on an algorithm that can create fingerprints accordingly, and I presume even sentences can be rephrased with the latest advancements in AI&#x2F;ML.<p>Also, some of the substitutions will be <i>unintentional</i>: a scribble on a piece of leaked document can also leak information about its leaker (different spellings in American and British English, ways of writing date &amp; time, decimal separators etc).<p>Can be defeated by paraphrasing.<p>----<p>The list can probably extended even further but this was all I could remember on the top of my head. =)<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16749422\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16749422</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IDN_homograph_attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IDN_homograph_attack</a><p>[x]: Not that I&#x27;m working in a related field, but I researched watermarking &amp; fingerprinting techniques for a similar but much more extensive project for journalists&#x2F;whistle-blowers to detect fingerprinting&#x2F;watermarking in documents.<p>Let me know if you are interested and we can collaborate!","time":1522860190,"type":"comment"},{"by":"armandososa","id":16756479,"kids":[16757530,16758565,16757574],"parent":16755425,"text":"that&#x27;s impressive.

I remember standing in the tiny Computer Science section at Barnes &amp; Noble where I found it, taking it home and cracking it open, and working through it until I had to make myself go to sleep. It&#x27;s the first programming book that really hooked me.","time":1522861931,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pavlov","id":16756776,"parent":16756243,"text":"&quot;Signs and Symbols: Their Design and Meaning&quot; by Adrian Frutiger","time":1522861952,"type":"comment"},{"by":"LukeShu","id":16756780,"parent":16756243,"text":"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment<p>It&#x27;s often a better reference than the POSIX spec is.","time":1522861978,"type":"comment"},{"by":"teolandon","id":16756785,"parent":16756388,"text":"they&#x27;re talking about OP&#x27;s extension that modifies how the website is presented.

It feels more like a small adaptation to your perspective &#x2F; addition to your base of reasoning.<p>Although it covers a plethora of topics, what really binds it together is the idea of &#x27;strange loops,&#x27; and how loops are existent in most everything, how they signal information, how they come in various steps, etc, etc, etc.. I&#x27;m sure the author would disagree with that summary actually, but it&#x27;s the best I can do.<p>In finance for example, it&#x27;s prompted me to more actively search for loops in any given analysis, and sometimes at a much more macro level. In politics, I&#x27;ve ended up thinking a lot more deeply about some loops of how civilizations progress and ideologies change.<p>To summarize: The book does a fantastic job at showing you how all of these loops are present throughout computer science, physics, chemistry, music, art, and practically everything imaginable. Once you realize the existence of these loops that you were previously oblivious to, you start to search for them more actively.

The answer differs significantly depending on the business goals of this system. But, I’ll assume the goal is acquire content at least once, and re-crawl it from time to time, something what Common Crawl does. I’ll start with defining the problem and then proceed with a possible solution.<p>My estimate of the world total count of web hosts is ~500M and registered domain names are at least 900M. There could be big websites with millions of pages, or small ones with only a few. Let’s assume we want to create a birds view collection and will be crawling of no more than 100 pages per website. Therefore the target is to crawl maximum ~50B pages. Some of the registrars are keeping their zone files private, and web is not ideally interlinked thus there is no way to discover all the hosts in general. But let’s limit the problem to 50B pages, just to make further design easier.<p>The data volume can be estimated using average, uncompressed page size of 60Kb. Overall, it turns out to be 3 Pb uncompressed and 1 Pb of data compressed with Snappy.<p>Next thing to think about is the time we would like to spend to acquire this content. Let’s say we’re poor and fine with just 6 months  It assumes we crawl ~280M pages daily, ~12M per hour and ~3240 per second. Also general throughput is expected to be ~190Mb per second and 2-4Gbit network connection should be enough for our cluster.<p>Alright, so this is how our engineering problem looks like. Let’s move on to the possible solution and answer the questions stated above.<p>There are not that many open source crawlers available capable of doing large scale crawls, but just to name few Apache Nutch, Heritrix and Frontera&#x2F;Scrapy. In this case I’ll stick with latter. It will require ~160 fetchers to run in parallel and 80 strategy workers to run the crawling strategy code. 1 core per process plus some overhead for monitoring&#x2F;links db storage&#x2F;queue operation resulting to ~280 cores, which is 7 modern machines 48 core each. This is only crawler part. Frontera requires Apache Kafka and HBase to operate, so it’s going to be around 10-12 more machines to run these services.<p>Q: How would you schedule and manage the crawlers?\nI would say there are two common ways to do that. Either your crawler operates in batches: crawl of the batch, stop, parsing, links extraction, crawl of the next batch and so on, or the crawler is online: e.g. it crawls, parses, extracts and schedules links without stops. The latter are usually faster. Batch operation is implemented in Nutch, using cmd line calls and online is done in Heritrix, StormCrawler and Frontera&#x2F;Scrapy.<p>The modern way to do that is to run the crawler processes in container farm.<p>Q: How would you collect and parse incoming data?\nDepending on the purpose. Online processing is getting popular these days. Have a look at Apache Kafka and Storm. There are many HTML and other types of documents parsers available open source.<p>Q: What would you use to store the data?\nThe main issue here is the way you’re going to access the data. If it’s an ad-hoc random access of document and occasional full scan then Apache HBase or other column-based storage is a way to go. If you’re going to perform full scan only (for example to collect some stats or build an index) then Apache Kafka or HDFS can be used as a storage.<p>Q: How would you process and draw meaning from the data?\nIn general case it’s Solr or Elastic. If there something specific needed then it could be sampling using linear scan and Apache Spark applied on sample. Again, these days are various workers running in docker containers and processing the content online is very popular.<p>Q: What information would be important to build a pagerank system for searching?\nPagerank requires only link graph. You would need to extract it from HTML content after the crawling. You could also use Apache Giraph or Spark GraphX to do the computations. These days Pagerank is abused for many commercial purposes and antispam filtering will be needed to clean up the graph.<p>Q: What other major components are missing?\nRendering engine. Many websites nowadays require Javascript executing and limit links discovery for non-browsers. \nDeduplication. Sometimes website serves the same content under different URLs, also stealing of the content on the web is quite common. So deduplication is need if you’re going to build a search engine.\nMonitoring. The crawl will take a long time, so it’s important to monitor the system performance (the current crawl speed aggregated, queue contents, etc.) and health.\nOrchestration. Your crawler is going to be a multiprocess application and it’s important to be able quickly and reliably run, finish and check status of all the processes.<p>Good luck.","time":1523008727,"type":"comment"},{"by":"marcc","id":16772140,"parent":16766717,"text":"You mention that you’ve had 2 in-person interviews for 100 applications.

Here are some of the main areas that are accessible to hobbyists (roughly in increasing order of difficulty):<p>- Digital electronics. Using microcontrollers to do things in the physical environment.<p>- Audio electronics. This is a fun area of electronics because the quality of what you build is directly reflected in how it sounds.<p>- Amateur radio electronics. Lets you talk to other people around the world. Harder than basic audio circuits because you need to know about antennas and radio operates at higher frequencies. Also requires passing an exam to get licensed, but studying for the exam helps with learning some of the theory.<p>- FPGAs. These are sexy, but not many applications that are that compelling for a hobbyist unless you have something very specific in mind. Plus you have to learn Verilog or another HDL and the way of thinking is very different than normal programming (since you&#x27;re effectively describing the hardware you want rather than an algorithm).<p>My advice is to first figure out which field you&#x27;re interested in, then find a project to work on related to that field.

Further, install this in known apps or as add-ons on setup for other apps.<p>- ISP offered &#x27;VPN client&#x27; that again, gives some cheaper monetary benefit like more data cap space or more speed &#x27;free&#x27;, strips out other advertising or tracking as a benefit.<p>- ISP offered &#x27;email client&#x27; that does all of the above.<p>- Check for subsequent request after page loads to known ad networks and replace with their own in HTTPS<p>- ISPs like you said may start throttling encrypted content down, or charging extra to allow it.<p>- ISP level proxy MITM, modem customization for &#x27;fast lanes&#x27; that are actually slow lanes.<p>- DNS level data collection not to inject but to sell marketing profiles via metadata and correlate with other data from apps.<p>Since ISPs are your &#x27;gateway&#x27; to the internet and you pay them, most people assume trust and privacy, most don&#x27;t know they bribed their way into the tracking&#x2F;ad business, many didn&#x27;t know cable tv modems had mics either. With that assumption of trust since people are paying them, they&#x27;ll more easily fall for any of the possible attack&#x2F;tracking vectors listed and more probably.<p>With the ISP privacy protections removed [1], my guess is most ISPs, due to lack of competition, end up more like hotel wifi where tracking&#x2F;injection is the norm [2] as it is completely legal now.

Also, some of those irons were meant for soldering sheet metal, not really electronics or electrical work - but that&#x27;s what people had at the time...<p>When I learned to solder thru-hole electronics, I learned with what could be called a &quot;cheap-o&quot; soldering iron; something like this (maybe not as nice looking):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circuitspecialists.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;image&#x2F;104526&#x2F;600&#x2F;sh-813a-220v-0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circuitspecialists.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;image&#x2F;104526&#x2F;600&#x2F;...</a><p>I still have it, and still use it occasionally. It takes &quot;forever&quot; to heat up (about 10-15 minutes), and the tip looks like hell. But for thru-hole construction, it works great. Once you know how to use it, you can solder like a champ.<p>Would I use it for SMT rework? No. Basically it&#x27;s virtually worthless for anything with less than 0.1&quot; pitch, unless you&#x27;re removing parts and just need to dump a lot of heat in a small area.<p>The key to successful soldering is knowing how to control and place the heat where you need it, and flowing the solder into the joint properly. Most make the mistake of not tinning their iron or the part leads, then trying to flow the solder using the tip of the iron, where all it does is stick the iron tip. Instead, you have to heat the component&#x27;s lead(s), and flow the solder using the heat on the lead(s). Tinning both the iron and the leads helps with this as well. Flux can also help, but if you use a decent flux-core solder (preferably 63&#x2F;37 ratio tin-lead), flux should rarely be needed. A paste flux is useful though for cleaning the tip of the iron, especially when shutting down for the day.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like arc welding. Sure, MIG can be easy to learn. But if you really want to understand, start with rod (stick) first. Yeah, you&#x27;ll stick the rod continuously, cussing a storm up at first. But after a while, you&#x27;ll develop the knack of keeping that weld pool just right and moving the rod while feeding it in, without sticking. Once you&#x27;ve done that, MIG is nothing...","time":1523052361,"type":"comment"},{"by":"kardos","id":16777896,"parent":16777092,"text":"&gt; I, too, use encrypted VPN, but we are just a minority.<p>You&#x27;re right that VPN usage is technically a minority [1], but it is well beyond fringe usage.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn2.hubspot.net&#x2F;hubfs&#x2F;304927&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;VPN-Usage-Around-the-World-Infographic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn2.hubspot.net&#x2F;hubfs&#x2F;304927&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;VPN-Usage-Ar...</a>","time":1523052374,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Magnets","id":16777912,"parent":16776209,"text":"Marco Reps\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;reppesis&#x2F;videos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;reppesis&#x2F;videos</a><p>Julian Ilett - especially if you want to learn about solar\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCmHvGf00GDuPYG9DZqQKd9A\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCmHvGf00GDuPYG9DZqQKd9A</a><p>Andreas Spiess\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ</a>","time":1523052538,"type":"comment"},{"by":"slig","id":16777914,"parent":16776670,"text":"Thanks!

So yeah, take it slow and take it easy on yourself as you&#x27;re learning. It&#x27;s more akin to asking, &quot;How to self-learn programming?&quot;. There are many methods, resources and STRONG opinions, mine included. Here&#x27;s my usual suggestions:<p>1.) Get into the culture of it all. Weird, right? But like lots of people are pointing out, YouTube has a bounty of electronics channels, one more niche than the next. There are also audio podcasts like Macrofab Engineering, Embedded.fm and The Amp Hour (disclaimer: this is my and EEVblog&#x27;s audio podcast)<p>2.) This is probably the most important -- once you&#x27;re a bit into the culture, you need something to shoot for. If the first part is figuring out WHY you want to build, then this part is figuring out WHAT you want to build. I would recommend starting with either a simple project (555 timer is a simple starting point) or slightly modifying someone else&#x27;s existing project. There are no new electronics circuits, so lean into kits from adafruit, sparkfun and the sellers on Tindie. This is a wonderful time for all of the kits in the world. Electronics are cheap and plentiful and simply following someone else&#x27;s instructions and getting the &quot;muscle memory&quot; for electronics is a good start.<p>3.) The last step is the HOW of electronics. This is going to be where peoples&#x27; opinions crop up the most. Some say start from the bottom up and learn semiconductors first. Others say you should start with firmware and arduinos and slowly learn what each piece is doing as you get into it more. To quote a familiar TV program, the right answer is probably &quot;middle out&quot;. This is also a practical answer, since there are always lower level concepts you can learn and higher level concepts you can learn.<p>I usually do not suggest The Art of Electronics to people getting started. Instead, I think they should use a project idea of what they want to build and Google. Again, a shitty answer, but this is the best method I&#x27;ve found. Most books start with &quot;What is Ohm&#x27;s Law&quot; and other math based operations and I think that&#x27;s not the right move for most people. It lost me when I was getting started and I&#x27;ve been doing hardware for 15 years.<p>If you&#x27;re unsure of where to start, make something blink. I have a short tutorial on how to build a circuit board, solder it up and blink it with a Rasbperry Pi. It sounds dumb, but it&#x27;s important to get the dopamine flowing.

Suppose instead of electronics I wanted to learn &quot;how does my mind move my finger?&quot;.  As a person with a mind and a finger the answer is quite simple: my mind creates the command and the finger moves.  While this is true, under the covers though the actual details are a lot more complex.  The good news is that electronics is a lot simpler than moving your finger.  The trick is to learn the simpler ideas that allow you do actual things without getting lost in the details.<p>Another problem is that once someone understands an area of learning they tend to want to teach it from a top down perspective.  In the case of electronics it&#x27;s &quot;well here&#x27;s Maxwell&#x27;s equations and it&#x27;s all you really need&quot;.  But people tend to learn better working from the bottom up.  Understanding various simple things and building up the abstract structure as they go.<p>So here&#x27;s my recommendation for a hierarchy of learning for electronics.  Understand that at each step you&#x27;re never getting &quot;the complete truth&quot; but also you&#x27;re not getting actual lies.<p>First electronics is divided into to types of things. Passive components and active components.  A resistor is a type of passive component and a transistor is a type of active component.<p>It&#x27;s best to get solid foundation in passive components before moving on to active components even though &quot;proper electronics&quot; is about active components.  That&#x27;s because most of the time active components are actually thought of as a kind of combination of passive components.<p>So start with a battery and a resistor and the equation V=IR.  While this seems way too simple it&#x27;s actually the idea that used in a lot of electronics so it&#x27;s good to understand it pretty well.  And it&#x27;s conceptually pretty clear.<p>Once you feel you have a good solid, unshakeable under standing of one resistor and a voltage supply move on to two resistors in series and then two resistors in parallel.  Calculate the voltage and current for each one.<p>Next keep adding resistors in arbitrary combinations up to say a dozen resistors and become confident that you can calculate the voltage and current regardless of any combination that is given to you.<p>At this point it&#x27;s very helpful to think of current in terms of water flow and voltage in terms of water pressure.  (The resistor is analogous to the size of the pipe that the water is flowing through) This analogy, with some refinements, goes a long way in electronics so it&#x27;s good to start thinking like this.<p>The next step is to take a look at a circuit of a resistor and a capacitor in series. This is the classic RC circuit that is used a lot. A capacitor can store energy and so its characteristics can be quite different than those of resistors.  However, with a little mathematical sleight of hand capacitors can be treated &quot;just as if they were resistors&quot; in many circumstances and this makes calculations (and thought processes) quite a lot easier.<p>Learn the mathematical techniques of analyzing circuits made of resistors and capacitors driven by both an AC voltage and a DC voltage for some very simple circuits.  One resistor and one capacitor is plenty for starting.<p>Note that these circuits have both a &#x27;transient phase&#x27; and a &#x27;steady state&#x27; phase.  You can think of this in terms of picking a ball up from the floor and then dropping it.  The time during which the ball is bouncing is the &#x27;transient&#x27; stage and after the ball stops bouncing that&#x27;s the &#x27;steady state&#x27; phase.  For the most part electronics concerns itself with the &#x27;steady state&#x27; phase.  However, a circuit driven by a steady AC (sinusoidal) voltage (or current) and be analyzed in a steady state manner even though the values are varying with time.<p>The other standard passive component is the inductor.  Don&#x27;t worry about it until you get quite confident in your understanding of capacitors since inductors are intuitively harder to figure out and mathematically both components are treated very similarly.<p>Active Components\nWhile there are quite a few &#x27;semiconductor&#x27; based active components simplify by studying the three main types first.  These are diodes, bipolar transistors(npn, pnp) and field effect transistors (FET&#x27;s).  The theory of how these devices actually work is very complicated and not really worth effort.  The diodes are quite simple to understand so start with those.<p>The transistors are trickier.  They operate in two modes, non-liner and linear.  Non-linear is messy and best left to later.  The linear regime is where these are mostly used and is conceptually not too difficult.  In fact they operate in a manner not much different than the knob that controls water flow (there&#x27;s that metaphor again) in your shower.  A transistor had three terminals one of the terminals is used to change the resistance value between the other two terminals.<p>In the case of bipolar transistors the controlling input is a current.  With FET transistors the controlling input is a voltage.<p>And that&#x27;s it really.  There are more complicated things like phase locked loops and more niche type devices like SCR&#x27;s but these are the basics.<p>Once you start to actually put circuits together do yourself the favor of learning to solder and wirewrap rather than using bread boards.  For a tiny bit of extra effort you&#x27;ll likely save yourself hours of frustration because your circuit connections will be much more reliable.","time":1523059450,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jaccarmac","id":16778604,"kids":[16782014],"parent":16776047,"text":"Really interesting.

You&#x27;re mostly going to be doing breadboarding at first anyway. And besides a cheap iron is fine.

My intro book was Craig Anderton&#x27;s &quot;Electronics Projects for Musicians&quot;.<p>From there, an indespensible resource in my education was diystompboxes.com&#x2F;smfforum (DIY electronics forum). Focus is on guitar effects, but there are people making amps, guitars, hi-fi, and digital gear as well.  The community there has an excellent core of helpful veteran DIYers and engineers, and a strong culture of sharing and teaching.<p>The humble Fuzz Face is generally a &quot;beginner&quot; level project which you can get working in an afternoon, yet if you drill down into <i>why</i> it works you&#x27;ve got enough to chew on to fill 2 or 3 college courses (at least 1 of those being a &quot;weed out&quot; level course).  This pedal was a staple of Jimi Hendrix, but he had a good ear and legend says he&#x27;d sort through boxes of them to find the good ones, because they varied a lot.\nThe <i>reason</i> they varied is because they were built around germanium transistors, which were low tolerance parts.  And the circuit itself is really high gain and temperature sensitive and has all sorts of caveats around it.<p>So if you covet that Jimi Hendrix-quality Fuzz Face sound, you need to deep dive into things like measuring hFE and keeping wiring clean around high-gain circuits to keep from turning it into an oscillator (or a radio).  There are numerous rabbit holes to explore, like &quot;do old school resistors sound better?&quot; or &quot;what if I want to power it from a normal +9V power supply instead of a battery?&quot;<p>Then you realize that turning the guitar&#x27;s volume knob down causes the Fuzz Face to totally change character from racous fuzz into something like a Brian May-esque treble boost, and why the heck does that happen?  It&#x27;s because the input to the Fuzz is a low impedance relative to the guitar, and causes the (mostly inductive) guitar pickup to be heavily loaded at high frequencies, making the distortion smoother than it would otherwise be.  So the guitar itself is part of the circuit, and inserting an active circuit (like another pedal) between the guitar and the Fuzz Face ruins everything!<p>So I guess my point is don&#x27;t go into it with the generic goal of &quot;learn electronics&quot;, instead have a specific goal like &quot;make the best Hi-Fi system possible for my living room, for under $2000&quot; or &quot;make a quadcopter from scratch&quot;.

I relied heavily on Sparkfun.com to get started.  Adafruit.com is also a strong competitor these days.  They each have a ton of really great tutorial material for beginners.  There are a lot of links here that people are listing that are great content but not for beginners.  Along the same lines I would explicitly avoid reading any books on the topic cover to cover.  I bought the Art of Electronics because it is billed as a bible for the field.  It is, but I never use it.<p>As for tools and supplies.  I would avoid buying very many things upfront* instead buy them as you need them to complete a project.  The only general tools I would buy are a multi-meter (Fluke 115), bread board, jumper wires, resistor kit [0], solder iron (Weller WE1010NA), and maybe oscilloscope &#x2F; digital logic analyzer combo like the Saleae Logic 8.  You can get all these things, name brand top quality tools, for about $800 total.  I would stay away from super cheap import type stuff to start.  Some of it is fine but it isn&#x27;t worth the frustration for a beginner when it doesn&#x27;t work.  The more expensive stuff will also grow with you as you get more advanced where as you will quickly out grow the cheapo stuff.<p>As far as formal equations you need to know the only ones I ever really use are V=IR (Ohm&#x27;s law) and P=IV.  If you paid attention in high school physics you probably already know these.<p>*The problem with buying a lot of stuff up front is that you end up with a bunch of less expensive stuff that doesn&#x27;t really grow with you or a pile of parts that are a pain to keep organized and are obsolete by time you get around to using them or that you can&#x27;t find datasheets on.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;10969\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;10969</a>","time":1523071670,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jakobegger","id":16779237,"parent":16764733,"text":"Yeah, you won‘t get far if you never tell anyone about your idea...","time":1523071798,"type":"comment"},{"by":"alooPotato","id":16779248,"score":1,"time":1523072008,"title":"Streak Is Hiring Product Engineers in SF","type":"job","url":"https://www.streak.com/careers#ProductEngineer"},{"by":"thrillgore","id":16779253,"parent":16775093,"text":"It would be nice if the US had GDPR policies like the EU has.

I will instead share a few simple things I wish somebody had told me:<p>1. Don&#x27;t stock up on components at the beginning. Only buy components that you need to build a chosen&#x2F;designed circuit. Passive assortments contain useless stuff like many slightly different values of nanofarad capacitors. They will waste space in your parts storage.\n1.1 Always keep your parts organized!<p>2. Surface mount (components sit on top of circuit board) is not hard. For any thru-hole circuit (components have wires that pass through holes in the circuit board), the surface mount equivalent will be easy to solder. Only the surface mount chips with tons of pins, like 32-bit CPUs, are tricky. Those don&#x27;t exist in thru-hole. Plus, if you start making PCBs, you won&#x27;t have to drill holes in them.<p>3. Classic op amps like the 741 and 358 suck. There are newer cheap op-amps that behave closer to the ideal model.<p>4. If you want to get into repair, practice desoldering before you desolder anything from an expensive board. It&#x27;s easy to damage components and board by overheating when struggling to desolder.","time":1523094330,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sutee","id":16780119,"parent":16779292,"text":"Do you mean Specs&#x27; Twelve Adler Museum Cafe?

Don&#x27;t go for the printed circuit boards yet. There are many circuits out there for beginners. Choose one and implement it. Vary the elements in the circuit. For example if the circuit asks you to use 10k ohm resister use a 100 ohm resister and see what happens. In this case there might be drop in voltage(I believe, my memory is quite vague). To measure this you use multimeter. Learn how to do that. It is fundamental for any one wanting to play with electronics stuff. \n(P.S: If you are from India there is a magazine named &quot;Electronics for you&quot;. If you have the money buy it. It is quite amazing. I haven&#x27;t read it 6 years though so I don&#x27;t know if the quality is still good)<p>Step 2: Start reading the datasheets of different Integrated Circuits that you might use in your circuit. Its not that hard. Once you understand what Vcc, ground etc., are it becomes really easy.<p>Step 3: Try and solder the the elements that you used on a board. Soldering is a basic skill that many engineers I know lack. It is good to know it. I have fixed many broken radios and other electronic items using this skill.<p>Step 4: Start designing printed circuit boards on a software and send it to a company and print it(there are other means to do this too).<p>Once you cover this, you can do a lot of really cool stuff with electronics. I hope this helps.<p>Note: This makes you an amateur. Now if you want to learn about FPGAs and other stuff, then its gets a little tricky.

The initial motivation for the project was a desire by telecom companies to obtain personally identifiable information and profiles for targeted advertising, and as we learned, a number of other interesting use cases, like reducing customer churn. At the NOCs there were a number of various servers in racks that were getting a feed of raw traffic for a variety of purposes. It wasn&#x27;t a free-for-all, but it was eye-opening. I recall reading through a Cisco router manual for example (not the company I worked for) and seeing its port-mirroring capabilities blatantly promoted as a means for customer profiling and targeted advertising.<p>Outside of the telecom industry itself there was quite a bit of resistance to this sort of thing, and we had to go before the US Congress to explain what we were up to. Profiling for the sake of profiling was not smooth sailing, but if it was for the purpose of &quot;security&quot; then it was more or less a free pass. The forcus of our DPI technology turned to the task of network-based threat detection as its primary raison d&#x27;être, with customer profiling being an opt-in service by which users could obtain the security service in exchange for targeted ads.<p>In the years since, I don&#x27;t expect that Telecom&#x27;s desire to be much more than a &quot;dumb pipe&quot; has diminished in the least. They view the traffic they carry on their networks to be their property, in a way. They feel entitled to inspect it, throttle it, slice and dice it any conceivable way they can to maximise their profits. Its one of the reasons I quit.<p>Imagine the US postal service steaming open every letter and opening every package that went through their system, so they could plug your mailbox with targeted special offers or increase the delivery fees for certain things. Its all similar BS with ISPs, but it&#x27;s all techie stuff and heavily lobbied so the public gets bamboozled.<p>You raise a really good point about wide-spread encryption being an impediment to ISP profiling. But there is a LOT you can surmise from user traffic even if you don&#x27;t know the exact content of the encrypted payloads. Just analyzing IP addresses and times can reveal a ton of information about a person. My first patent [US20100161795] was in fact a NAT session detection and tracking technique to identify and track individual users within a household through TCP&#x2F;IP analysis. Using this technique someone <i>could</i> get a pretty clear picture of how many people were in a household, their ages, genders, interests and patterns of activity, even without delving into the http payload of the packets.  We didn&#x27;t, but this kind of thing is most definitely possible, and I wouldn&#x27;t trust other shady entities not to do it.","time":1523115746,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dbcurtis","id":16781218,"parent":16776004,"text":"Agree with the sentiment, but amateur radio isn&#x27;t the only game in town.

Next, I turned to the textbook at AllAboutCircuits.<p>Next thing I did was design and build a DC lab. I bought my meters and scopes outright, but designed and built my own DC load and power supply. Since I&#x27;d already watched Dave&#x27;s videos about them on EEVBlog, they were obviously influenced by his design, but I made a couple of non-trivial changes to the spec so that I&#x27;d have to make my own design decisions. I found this electronics stackexchange post very helpful for heat dissipation calculations [0]. Also, while it&#x27;s very simple and not suitable for complex or precise work, Falstad&#x27;s circuit simulator was very helpful for experimenting [1].<p>My next step was fixing things. This gave me an opportunity to do a bunch of things:<p>* Become familiar with ICs. At first I always had to look up the number on every IC I saw to figure out how it was supposed to behave before I could test if its actual behavior matched, but over time you&#x27;ll start recognizing those numbers and understanding why it was chosen over another component that does the same job.<p>* Drawing schematics. Debugging is really hard without a schematic, so on anything remotely complex, my first step was often searching for a schematic. This search often came up empty, so my second step would be following all the traces and looking up all the chips so that I could draw a circuit diagram and figure out roughly what I should expect.<p>* Soldering. This should be fairly self-explanatory.<p>Frankly, I haven&#x27;t gotten past here yet. I&#x27;m not terribly good with AC theory or RF stuff.

Which itself increases the bugs because it&#x27;s a lot easier to make a mistake when you are doing something repetitive 50 times, as opposed to declaring it right once somewhere.<p>Other useful ones could be having some expressions that are not strictly binary or function calls.<p>And the ability to define these for custom types.<p>For example &quot;user is administrator&quot;, &quot;1001 (is|is not) palindrome&quot;, &quot;100 is divisible by at least 2 of [1, 10, 50]&quot;.<p>Another one, accessing attributes&#x2F;fields, &quot;firstName of user&quot;, &quot;factors of 100&quot;, &quot;favoritePosts of user&quot;.<p>Tests about attributes&#x2F;fields, &quot;if user has twoFactorAuthentication&quot;.<p>Another one, more &quot;space freindly&quot; languages. So you could do &quot;let the thing we are printing := &#x27;test&#x27;;&quot;.<p>Now let me say I&#x27;m fully aware most of what I have said is very difficult if not impossible.<p>The problem is language complexity and parsing and also composition. The examples I have made don&#x27;t really hold up in general cases or compose well so it&#x27;s hard to fit them in general purpose languages.<p>If we were using projectional structure editors they would be much much easier to achieve. Because we wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with language rules like that. You could render the program structure in a human friendly way without forcing the computer to parse and understand the same thing.<p>One of the biggest bottlenecks with programming languages today is that humans and computers are sharing a text based language with each other. And as a result we have to compromise on it to achieve a balance where it&#x27;s easy enough for the computer to parse and understand and easy enough for humans to read and write.<p>If we could separate the two we could optimise the languages for ourselves and let the computers use something much more precise and unambigious like binary under the hood that makes them happy.<p>All much easier said than done.","time":1523121999,"type":"comment"},{"by":"decebalus1","id":16781708,"kids":[16781886],"parent":16781564,"text":"I don&#x27;t see it as a complaint but as a piece of feedback and if you&#x27;re the author then you may want to revisit your attitude.","time":1523122582,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mcphage","id":16781715,"kids":[16781858],"parent":16781295,"text":"Pronouns, for starters.

The use of “high-level” programming paradigms and object-oriented languages helps, but fundamentally remains far from solving the problem. Most programming languages and systems have fallen prey to the assumption that they are supposed to capture idealized models of computation inspired by deceptively simple metaphors such as objects and mathematical functions. Aspect-oriented programming languages have made a significant breakthrough by noticing that, in many situations, humans think and describe in crosscutting terms. In this paper we suggest that the next breakthrough would require looking even closer to the way humans have been thinking and describing complex systems for thousand of years using natural languages. While natural languages themselves are not appropriate for programming, they contain a number of elements that make descriptions concise, effective and understandable. In particular, natural languages referentiality is a key factor in supporting powerful program organizations that can be easier understood by humans.","time":1523122830,"type":"comment"},{"by":"eesmith","id":16781745,"parent":16781295,"text":"Damian Conway explored some of this topic in &quot;Lingua::Romana::Perligata -- Perl for the XXI-imum Century&quot;.

You want to exchange encrypted messages with this server, so you use RSA encryption right?<p>Nope. In the almost-published TLS 1.3 you proceed as follows: 1. Use ephemeral Diffie-Hellman to agree random new symmetric encryption keys, and immediately use those to do AEAD encryption for everything further 2. Send (encrypted) your Certificate. 3. Take a transcript of everything that happened so far, and _sign_ that transcript using RSA, send (encrypted) the signature.<p>This setup means an attacker can&#x27;t make even a dumb server do any operations with their RSA private key except signing transcripts of sessions in which that server got to make random key choices. This is useless for any conceivable shenanigans so long as RSA is no more insecure that we think it is, and even if RSA is insecure, you need to actively penetrate specific sessions, the DHE protects any other sessions, even if you subsequently get all the private keys.","time":1523123272,"type":"comment"},{"by":"stolsvik","id":16781783,"kids":[16782626],"parent":16775662,"text":"Does that matter much when your next DNS lookup is erectiledysfunction.org and your next ip packets go to the ip address of that domain?","time":1523123339,"type":"comment"},{"by":"__david__","id":16781789,"parent":16781294,"text":"I usually appreciate the animated gif screenshot (especially for curses based programs), but this particular animated gif would have been better off as just plain text—there&#x27;s too much interesting data that can&#x27;t be copied, it&#x27;s real hard to go back to look at something that you missed and it&#x27;s frustrating to have to wait while fake typing happens.

But they&#x27;re still very good at that.<p>2. Since collision resistance is a stronger notion of security than preimage resistance and second preimage resistance, achieving collision resistance achieves all three. I just wanted to make this point explicit. Likewise, <i>indistinguishability</i> is an even stronger notion and subsumes all three.<p>3.

The idea is that for small utility methods, you shouldn&#x27;t have to interrupt your main flow of thought to come up with names for your formal parameters; in fact, you shouldn&#x27;t even have to name your locals.  If you&#x27;re working in a language with a (perhaps already verbose) static type system, you can just leverage that.<p>So, for example, instead of this:<p><pre><code>  appendNode(node: Node): void {\n    this.tail.next = node;\n    this.tail = node;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n... you can do:<p><pre><code>  appendNode(Node): void {\n    this.tail.next = the Node;\n    this.tail = the Node;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis does introduce some precedence&#x2F;binding gotchas that I go more into.  But that hints towards further improvements.  From the aforementioned post, you could end up with a language that allows:<p><pre><code>  the ControlMessage&#x27;s id := defocus\n</code></pre>\nOr, if you add support for &quot;passive voice&quot; to your language:<p><pre><code>  id from the ControlMessage := defocus\n</code></pre>\nCompletely unrelated, but related to the use of &quot;the&quot;, Carmack wrote a tweet[2] that I&#x27;ve got embedded in the comments of a project of mine.<p>&gt; I have moved to naming global singletons with a The* prefix -- ThePacketServer, TheMasterServer, TheVoip, etc. Feels pretty good.<p>Since then, I stopped creating &quot;proper&quot; singletons altogether.  Instead, it&#x27;d be a quasi-singleton, where I write a `MasterServer` class, and then bless an instance as `TheMasterServer`.

The project was led by one of the founders of Infosys who ran as a Member of Parliament for the opposition Congress party. Each political party takes potshots at it when they are not in power but it has support across the aisle. From my (albeit limited) understanding, Aadhaar is simply authentication - and not tracking.<p>The intelligentsia in India defines themselves by opposition to Aadhaar. There is a huge cacophony of bollywood stars, writers, intellectuals and of course civil libertarians opposing Aadhaar. What is lost is the colossal leakage (euphemism for corruption) in benefits, the lack of existence of hundreds of millions of citizens and the resulting parasitism of political machines to get them benefits of the old system.<p>Does anyone have anything else in mind that would work better? Or is this simply opposition for opposition sake?<p>(edits for clarity)","time":1523128320,"type":"comment"},{"by":"richrichardsson","id":16782254,"kids":[16782348,16782294,16782281],"parent":16782212,"text":"Pluses are part of email standard, dots are some nonsense Google thought was a good idea.","time":1523128355,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jamesfisher","id":16782255,"kids":[16782404,16782480,16782351,16783448,16782444,16782510],"parent":16782204,"text":"I think these are orthogonal issues.

Someone created a Netflix account using a dot-variant of my Gmail and at some point, I received a similar email asking me to update my payment info. Right from the email, I saw it wasn&#x27;t my account and thought someone else used my email by mistake (this happens a lot to me because I have a common name and a short email address).<p>What I usually do is request a password reset and delete the account or just remove my email address from the account. But in the Netflix case, the &quot;update payment&quot; button on the email log you to the account without asking for the password or anything. For the most part, people sign up to junk services&#x2F;games or is just creating a throwaway account. But this was looking like a legit mistake. This person was actually using the Netflix account and had the payment info there and everything. I tried to just change the email address to something else but it required to confirm the password to change the email. I could just request a new password and change the email, but I was trying to be careful here because I didn&#x27;t want to screw this person. I started to investigate a little bit more. Maybe this person had the account connected to Facebook, so it would be okay to change the password and remove my email and the account owner would still be able to log in. But it wasn&#x27;t the case. I checked the watch history, just Peppa Pig and movies for kids. The name in the account was a female name. Probably a mom that created a Netflix account for her child. At this point, I was feeling super guilt to remove my email address and lock this person out of the account. All I could think of was a monday morning, the password not working, the kid crying out loud, the mom trying to figure it out. Anyway, I was just trying to not cause someone trouble.<p>So I thought about trying to find this person on Facebook or something. She had a not very common name so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard. The payment method on Netflix was direct debit, so I had her bank account number. From the bank account number, I got the number of the bank&#x27;s agency, and a quick google I discovered in which city her bank&#x27;s agency was located, so it made the Facebook search very precise. There I was looking at her Facebook page. The profile picture it was a happy family of three: mom, dad, and the little child. Browsing a little bit her public feed I learned that her kid had my name (Vitor) and that explained why the account name had her name and the email address was a different name (her kid).

It&#x27;s better to minimize the amount of real-time components in your application as there are very few things that need to be real-time. Secondly, the pub-sub caching mechanism made it infeasible for situations with many concurrent users. I was able to get around this by proxying some of their internal functions.<p>Significant people in the ecosystem started leaving (e.g. Arunoda), probably for the same reasons. AFAIK, it&#x27;s still the best JavaScript framework out there for prototyping and MVPs. Their accounts system makes whipping up a user-driven application trivial.

Also, for scale-out databases you can compile the query once and ship the binary or IR to every relevant node, which amortizes the compilation cost.<p>For classic OLTP workloads, JIT compilation doesn&#x27;t carry much benefit because you are (typically) directly targeting a few records. The primary benefit is for constraint matching in page scan operators.

These workloads (basically &quot;real-time analytics&quot;) are increasingly popular.<p>Before I had experience designing systems with JIT compiled queries I worried quite a bit about overhead.

So I agree with codetrotter that the third option is best of the three, to protect the two people from each other.<p>The possible disadvantage I see with the third option however is that if you are at a service desk, and they are trying to sign  you up for a membership of some sort, they can&#x27;t complete your registration on the spot.  You would have to go home and use the computer to complete your registration (unless you can use email client on your smartphone).  Which means they may lose a possible member if they don&#x27;t ensure that you finish the registration right there and then.<p>For that reason it may be better to collect the email address, all customer details, and the desired password (typed twice).  Then when the confirmation link is sent, the confirmation link should take you to a link that asks you for your password again (once) before your account is validated.  This ensures that the person at the service desk is really the person using the email account to do the validation.  Mere access to the email account should not be enough.  The main advantage here is to make sure as little\nwork as possible is left to the customer to do by himself when he gets home.  I agree that this is a lot more messy than Doug Webb&#x27;s approach, because the only accounts in that approach are validated accounts.<p>However to the extent that one does not want to lose a possible new membership because someone went home and decided not to continue the process because it is a lot of work, it may be worth it.","time":1523145832,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ams6110","id":16783782,"kids":[16783847,16784256,16783805,16783930],"parent":16783110,"text":"Travel is overrated, and environmentally catastrophic.

Like correcting someone&#x27;s grammar, one should get the facts straight first. So many here have also got it wrong, so it&#x27;s not super surprising but those posters here haven&#x27;t gone and published a righteous article making wrong conclusions.<p>First, this is all on Netflix. Regardless of what any provider does, Netflix has to protect its own accounts and the obvious way to do that is to verify an email address before taking payment info. It could do that in a specific way (per-provider, understanding how gmail specifically treats addresses) but treating it in a generic way seem better and insulates them from changes to gmail or other providers.<p>Now, gmail certainly could do things that bring attention to the quirks of their own platform, but that doesn&#x27;t take any of the onus off of Netflix or any other service to DTRT themselves.<p>The flaws in the article:<p>1. You cannot have an infinite number of addresses. per RFC 5321 par 4.5.3.1.1, only 64 chars are allowed in the mailbox name.<p>2. Further, unless the mailbox is quoted, eg &quot;mailbox&quot;, then dots may not be at the beginning or the end, and consecutive dots are not allowed. (RFC 5322, par 3.4.1 and 3.2.3). The article doesn&#x27;t mention the need for quoting in its description of &quot;infinite&quot; addressing. This is due to the use of dots to atomize the text around it, for domain name parsing. It happens to be used in the local-part for some reasons, I suppose because dot isn&#x27;t otherwise allowed and they didn&#x27;t want to create another named grammar item.<p>3. There is no requirement for plus or dot to be non-unique elements. RFC 5233 defines plus addressing, but this only applies to systems that care to treat the plus in this special way. There&#x27;s no general requirement that foo+bar and foo+baz are both subaddresses of the foo mailbox; they could instead be 2 distinct addresses. The specific relevance is that Netflix should treat plus just like dot -- don&#x27;t treat it specially.","time":1523150294,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rdl","id":16784016,"kids":[16784363,16784102,16784385,16784419,16784083],"parent":16783590,"text":"I don&#x27;t know how big a deal the harness really is.

Aside from professional statisticians general dislike of pie charts, you cannot plot confidence intervals in this way into a pie chart just by inserting &#x27;more white space between the slices&#x27;.

The MySQL package provides finer-grained control over reactivity by allowing you to provide your own custom trigger functions.<p>Accordingly, we put a lot of thought into our MySQL schema design and coded our custom trigger functions to be selective as possible to prevent SQL queries from being needlessly executed and wasting CPU, IO and network bandwidth by publishing redundant updates to the client.<p>As we know, Meteor is tightly integrated with MongoDB which we did not consider to be well-suited to our needs. Did this result in us ranting publicly about how Meteor and&#x2F;or MongoDB are “dying” or “having no future”? No!<p>Instead, we found a way to embrace and extend Meteor - an ongoing task.<p>In terms of scalability in general, are we limited to a single Node.js process? Absolutely not - we use Nginx to terminate the connection from the client and spread the load across multiple Node.js processes. Similarly, MySQL master-slave replication allows us to spread the load across a cluster of servers.<p>In my view, the reason why Meteor is not more popular is because too few people are sharing their Meteor success stories and the MDG has not been doing much to promote Meteor publicly.<p>More people need to showcase their Meteor-based solutions and stories of success at technical conferences and developer meetups and events - especially those that concern NodeJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Databases, IoT and WebApps in general.<p>And what makes Meteor superior to plain Node.js development? We get much higher productivity from our programmers who can write less code and make fewer mistakes developing in Meteor compared to say using Node.js with express. Here are 3 benefits we enjoy:<p>1) Meteor&#x27;s use of fibers allows a synchronous programming style whilst avoiding callback hell. Meteor has an easy to use facility Meteor.wrapAsync() that allows you to use run any callback function, e.g. from a third-party package, within a fiber. There is also Promise.await() that does the same thing for packages that use Promises.<p>2) The isomorphic design promotes code reuse between the client and server-side and simplifies client-server communications. You simply decide whether you want to implement a Meteor method or a Meteor publication based on your application&#x27;s needs.<p>3) Meteor&#x27;s inbuilt, easy-to-use data validation methods promote secure, robust code.<p>In summary, Meteor is much greater than the sum of its parts.","time":1523151575,"type":"comment"},{"by":"lttlrck","id":16784083,"kids":[16784661],"parent":16784016,"text":"And even with the ‘perfect’ harness, you still need to keep your composure and only unbuckle when the water stops rushing in. \nI did a dunk test when I was 15 - remaining composed was the problem, even with rescue divers in scuba gear. \nWe didn’t have air lines in the cabin either (unlike the video you linked) - we had to hold our breath the entire time.","time":1523151587,"type":"comment"},{"by":"thexa4","id":16784084,"parent":16783894,"text":"If you can create a function that creates an infinite grid of buildings you can blend that using another perlin noise function.<p>The techniques used in raytracing can probably help as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KYekhnLHGms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KYekhnLHGms</a>","time":1523151600,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tapirl","id":16784088,"kids":[16784109],"parent":16781959,"text":"The opinion of the author is ridiculous.\nWhat about someone use your email, without dots, to register as a netfix user?","time":1523151707,"type":"comment"},{"by":"incongruity","id":16784089,"kids":[16784365],"parent":16784050,"text":"I agree, in this case, you’re right on (and I have another comment saying as much) but <i>couldn’t</i> there be a UI that <i>guides</i> you safely through some of those dangers?

The Monolith is an interstellar &quot;seed&quot; sent out to stimulate the development of other forms of sentient life.  This scene is supposed to depict the Monolith stimulating humanity&#x27;s primate ancestors to develop tool usage (bones as clubs&#x2F;etc) and catalyzing our societal development as a result.<p>Next, we see Humanity discover the Tycho Monolith buried on the moon.  As the lunar dawn strikes it, it unleashes a massive burst of radio energy towards Jupiter and goes silent.  This is implied as being an alert that Humanity has reached a crucial stage of development and the stage is set for the completion of its mission.  You can alternately view it as an energy-based life-form shifting from one repository&#x2F;location to another.  So the Jupiter Monolith could potentially be interpreted as being the same sentience&#x2F;AI&#x2F;etc.<p>The other confusing scene is the ending, where Bowman travels through the Jupiter Monolith and becomes a Star Baby.  This is the Monolith finishing its mission, and allowing Bowman to shed his corporeal body and become a being of pure energy, like the Monolith and its creators.<p>So all in all, the movie depicts the Monolith guiding humanity through all the stages of its evolution, from primates to a higher plane of existence.  Then we have several artistic interludes that connects these scenes... an idealistic depiction of humanity&#x27;s technological development as Floyd travels to the moon, and then a horror sequence as one of our creations malfunctions and becomes murderous.<p>The book is vastly more comprehensible than the movie, without some of the narration that Kubrick cut it&#x27;s pretty difficult to follow what&#x27;s going on.  On the other hand, from an artistic perspective, narration would have ruined the film (imagine David Attenborough narrating...) so it&#x27;s easy to see why Kubrick didn&#x27;t go that route, and his imagery actually does fit the sequences Clarke describes perfectly, <i>as long as you understand what&#x27;s going on</i>.

The attraction of R is that you get a model out in three lines, rather than 14 errors and no result telling you that there are issues involving realms of thought you didn&#x27;t know you were ignorant in and you&#x27;ll have to go away and study before you continue, or even that your data might not be suitable for what you&#x27;re doing.

There is very little opportunity for an individual interventionalist to increase his patient volume independently (at least for ischemic stroke).<p>I agree in principle with most of the points you make, although I think perverse incentives are largely a function of   the US healthcare system in general rather than the domain of any particular specialty.<p>In specific relation to the original article, I&#x27;m extremely doubtful that combing two anti-thrombotic agents would be a miraculous therapeutic regime for treating stroke but I&#x27;d be happy to be proved wrong by a legitimate trial. However, I&#x27;d worry that we&#x27;d be sacrificing patients that could otherwise be treated if we assigned them to an arm of a trial that precludes established therapy.","time":1523156214,"type":"comment"},{"by":"lev99","id":16784367,"parent":16784123,"text":"I was thinking porn.","time":1523156218,"type":"comment"},{"by":"kingrolly","id":16784368,"parent":16784074,"text":"Porkbun - cheap, fast and support is quick to reply.

However, after viewing the edited scenes with the &quot;temporary&quot; background music, Kubrick decided that he really liked it that way -- and so rather than using the score which North was composing and recording, he re-edited the video to match the tempo of the classical recordings he had used.<p>Legend has it that Kubrick didn&#x27;t know how to break the news to North -- but however it happened, North turned up for the premiere expecting to hear the music he had spent six months composing and recording, and was devastated to hear the supposedly &quot;temporary&quot; music used instead.","time":1523161569,"type":"comment"},{"by":"devin","id":16784618,"parent":16784061,"text":"No, it has received frequent updates.","time":1523161615,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mudil","id":16784619,"kids":[16784675],"parent":16784163,"text":"Facebook and Google control close to 85% of the digital ad market.

I haven&#x27;t looked at the RFC in some time, but I don&#x27;t believe the use of plus suffixes is standard either. Nonetheless, I believe plus suffixes are more commonplace, generally permitted, and serve a reasonable purpose. For instance, sending email to a user using their email address as provided is a good practice in order to preserve a plus suffix which may aid the user in organizing their email. At the same time, canonicalizing email addresses in a sensible way, e.g. stripping plus suffixes, can be an aid for preventing unintentional, duplicate sign-ups. Just consider a sign-up form on the homepage of a website. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to enter their email and password into that form by mistake thinking they&#x27;re signing in. Additionally, if the website compares canonical email addresses when checking login credentials, then a user who signed up with an email address containing a plus suffix can sign in using their base email. These two situations combined could lead to the accidental creation of a duplicate account if canonical email addresses are not compared during registration. There are some trade offs with this strategy, but as long as the canonicalization is implemented <i>reasonably</i>, I see it as an aid to the user. Note that reasonably doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean stripping dots.<p>As for the second point, I consider it a privacy breach if a service publicly associates my email address with their service without my consent. Sign-up forms do this when giving different responses when an email address is registered vs not registered.<p>As for how to handle it, if a user signs up with a new email address, you send them an email to verify their email address and instruct them to check their email. Similarly, if a user attempts to sign up with an already registered email address, you send them an email letting them know they already have an account and instruct them to check their email, which will provide them with a link to login.<p>In the latter case, if they enter the correct password, you can just directly tell the user they already have an account, as they&#x27;ve proven their identity.","time":1523163281,"type":"comment"},{"by":"voltagex_","id":16784678,"parent":16784543,"text":"&quot;Wasabi is deployed in fully secure and redundant data centers that are certified for SOC-2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS.

For several reasons.<p>But it&#x27;s not enough to just be better than the cotton candy fluff of recent movies, since that&#x27;s not a real competition. It&#x27;s a solid movie that stands on its own, even despite some quirky flaws in the delivery and editing of the performances.<p>It&#x27;s not Rocky Horror Picture Show, where you and your friends have a party, and participate. It&#x27;s more of a sleepy, quiet time movie like Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver, and any other classic movie, it gets better with repeated viewing, as more details tie together.<p>It&#x27;s not a mind blowing movie, but for it&#x27;s time, it dealt with a lot of new themes in extremely subtle ways, without excessive treatment. The future was cast as a recognizable, ordinary reality, taking on a tone that really only draws a cult following, but warrants substantial appreciation.<p>Movies like this don&#x27;t get made anymore because risking a budget on cult appreciation doesn&#x27;t land well in a pitch, especially amid the modern environment of implicit piracy, if it&#x27;s fair to label shared viewing as such.<p>Whether it was the first movie to feel vaguely cyberpunk-ish or not, doesn&#x27;t matter much anymore, but Blade Runner had a deep gravitational pull that influenced visual concepts of the near future well into the late nineties.<p>Without a sequel, all of the open-ended background trivia that was never elaborated upon, left open a whole universe to imagine, and this is where the cultural resonance ties in. The people who enjoyed the movie were left free to speculate about what really went on in the off world colonies, given the curiousities revealed by film.<p>I wish more movies were like Blade Runner. It&#x27;s a rare item. It&#x27;s not a movie you watch once. It&#x27;s not a blockbuster.
